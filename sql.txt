SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT
    OD.OrderID,
    P.ProductName,
    OD.Quantity
FROM
    OrderDetails AS OD
JOIN
    Products AS P
ON
    OD.ProductID = P.ProductID;

Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,

SELECT
    (Employees.FirstName || ' ' || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,
    OrderDetails.ProductID,
    OrderDetails.Quantity
FROM
    Orders
JOIN
    Employees
ON
    Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
JOIN
    OrderDetails
ON
    Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID;
